    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    //without passing nothing in slice we have a copy of the same array
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread (best way)
    const team4 = [...players];

    //or

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed



    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //this is a reference no t a copy
    const captain = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
   const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 12});
   console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        }
    };
    console.log(mauro);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, mauro);
    dev.name = 'Another Mauro';
    console.log(dev);
    //this gave an error for the copy of the sub object, a solution can be stringify all the object
    const mauro2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mauro));
    console.log(mauro2);
    mauro2.name = 'M';
    mauro2.social.ig = 'nothing found';
